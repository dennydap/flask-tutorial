## Introduction
In order to finish my bachelor degree, I need to create a system that can read passports and fetch the data using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which works well in Python. Unfamiliar in web development in Python, this repository is made in order to learn how Flask works because to tell you the truth I don't really understand Python.

For those who wondering, I learn from the official tutorial in the Flask website, which you can find [here.](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/)
